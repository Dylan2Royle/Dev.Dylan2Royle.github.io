        At the of 19 years old, I have experience using languages such as PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with some Python programming under my belt. Currently, I'm in the process of learning microprogramming with ESP32/8266. Additionally, I enjoy exploring the world of 3D printing and incorporating Easter eggs into my code. They May be one on this website or in the website code.

        Aside from coding, I keep up-to-date with the latest games, both modern and retro, through my social media channels. I'm also passionate about staying informed about the newest technological developments and strongly believe in the positive impact that technology can have on our lives. The rapidly expanding field of A.I. and the boom in coding technology only further emphasize the potential for positive growth.
